An experiment of a collaboration app for grinds. So far the idea is to use
something like WebRTC for video, and etherpad lite for collaboration. Final tech
used will be decided at some stage!

# Usage
Serve the files in the core folder (with something like node http-server). You
will need to start up a mysql container and an etherpad container (see `run*.sh`
files)
